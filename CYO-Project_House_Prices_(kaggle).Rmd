# Overview

## Dataset Preparation
The house prices dataset can be found on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or, alternatively, in my [**Github repository**](https://github.com/mpwweihrauc/ML_House_Prices.git). We will work with the `test.csv` and `train.csv` files. There is also a `data_description.txt` with descriptions about all the different parameters in the dataset.
