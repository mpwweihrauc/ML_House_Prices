# Exploring a house price dataset with a large amount of variables to predict house prices.

In this project I conduct exploratory data analysis and data wrangling on a house price dataset from Kaggle. I also develop several machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on a relatively large number of variables about houses.
Please see the project report written in RMarkdown for a thorough look at the project.
